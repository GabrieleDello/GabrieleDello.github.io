Delft, the Netherlands. February 25, 2025. \
It is a day that I will remember for the rest of my life.\ 

Lot of excitment, fear, stress, sweat as well - keep that a secret, but also joy, satisfaction, and gratefulness. I spent the day with most of my amazing friends, the ones I used to catch up with regularly in Delft. That was the best part of the day.\
Teddy, a big friend of mine, told me: *we are creating memories. You were so right, Teddy. 

The video recording of my PhD defense ceremony is available [here](https://nmclive.tudelft.nl/mediasite/play/5d2167e97e094e81a24dbac6443ca3db1d).
