***Make cycling safer for children!***

**What's it about?**
As researchers at [KTH Royal Insitute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/), we are studying vibrations exposure for humans. Our goal is to better understand the ride experience for children to help improve future products and make your journeys as smooth as possible.

**How can you help?**
It's simple! We will mount a small, lightweight acceleration sensor on your bicycle for few days. This will allows us to record the accelerations experienced by the children during transport. You just use it as you normally would on your morning trip to school. That's it! No special instructions or changes to your routine.

• Forget it's there! The sensor just quietly collects data\
• No stress. There are no special requests or tasks for you

We are looking for parents who use:\
✔️ Cargo Bikes\
✔️ Bike Trailers

**Your journey can help make a difference!**
