Hi, I‚Äôm **Gabriele Dell‚ÄôOrto**.  
Welcome to my website! üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Here I post news from my ongoing research, advertise calls, personal thoughts, passion, reportage from the fields, and so on. Topics? Everything! Mostly research interest, cycling or sport related posts, tractors and agriculture. As well as food, museums, trips. Enjoy!  

**A little bit about myself**

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [KTH Royal Insitute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/), Stockholm (Sweden), specializing in advanced tyre mechanics, experimental testing, comfort and vibration. I aim to translate cutting-edge academic research into practical, tangible solutions that enhance vehicle safety, urban mobility, and performance. My research interests span urban mobility fleet (I am a member of EIT Urban Mobility-DTN), cycling, professional cycling, light vehicles for urban mobility, tyres dynamics, comfort, vibrations, children safety, strollers.

Born and raised in Italy, I have always cultivated a deep passion for mechanics, agriculture machines, and cycling. After the master degree in Mechanical Engineering, I pursued a double degree PhD from [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) (the Netherlands) and [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/) (Italy).
In 2023, I moved to lovely Delft (the Netherlands) to complete my second half of my PhD. I joined the "TU Delft Bicycle Lab", founded by Dr. Arend Schwab and now lead by Dr. Jason K. Moore. The "Dutch period" was my golden age, and it will always have a special place in my heart. Too many good memories to list. I defended my dissertation "[Bicycle tyre lateral characteristics and their effect on bicycle dynamics]({% post_url 2025-09-12-dissertation %})" in February 2025, with a memorable Dutch-style ceremony. Watch it [here](https://nmclive.tudelft.nl/mediasite/play/5d2167e97e094e81a24dbac6443ca3db1d). Quite long, but it's worth it!
